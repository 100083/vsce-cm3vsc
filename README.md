This package provides syntax highlighting and snippets for Modula-3 and Quake.

[Modula-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-3) was [designed](https://doi.org/10.1145/142137.142141) in the late 1980s as a systems programming language based on Modula-2, which was designed by Niklaus Wirth, and Modula-2+, which was previously developed at Digital Equipment Corporation.  Its major implementation today is [Critical Mass Modula-3 (CM3)](https://github.com/modula3/cm3).

Quake is a small structured scripting language designed for writing makefiles for CM3 projects.
